*How this application works?*

1) A user writes the title of the book, author name and number of pages. 
2) The user checks the *Read?* checkbox if they read the book.
3) The book is stored in the library after the user clicks SUBMIT.
4) The added books don't disappear when the user refreshes the browser.
